GraphQL Testing Library provides utilities for creating [Mock Service Worker](https://mswjs.io/) (MSW) [request handlers](https://mswjs.io/docs/concepts/request-handler/) for [GraphQL](https://graphql.org/) APIs.

This guide will help you get started with MSW, create a request handler using a GraphQL schema and begin writing tests that can run in Node.js, the browser or React Native.

<Aside type="tip">

Just as MSW allows you to "write client-agnostic mocks and reuse them across any frameworks, tools, and environments," GraphQL Testing Library is also client-agnostic: you can use it with any GraphQL client, or no client at all!
