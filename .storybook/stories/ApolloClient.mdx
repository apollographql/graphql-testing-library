# Apollo Client Demo

The `Apollo/App` and `Apollo/AppWithDefer` stories provide two examples of a MSW handler generated by this library resolving a request originating from an Apollo Client app.

## `App` query
In `App`, a single JSON response is generated using the mock resolver found in [`src/__tests__/mocks/handlers.ts`](https://github.com/apollographql/graphql-testing-library/blob/main/src/__tests__/mocks/handlers.ts).

<Source language="graphql" code={`
query AppQuery {
  products {
    id
    reviews {
      id
      rating
    }
    title
    mediaUrl
  }
}
`} />

## `AppWithDefer` query
In `AppWithDefer`, the same mock resolver is used to generate the response, but the presence of `@defer` prompts the generated MSW handler to reply with a multipart response using the proposed [incremental delivery over HTTP](https://github.com/graphql/graphql-over-http/blob/main/rfcs/IncrementalDelivery.md) specification. While the inline fragment is pending, the `Reviews` component displays a `-` in place of the missing data.

View the response in the browser devtools network tab to inspect the multipart response after the final chunk has arrived.

<Source language="graphql" code={`
query AppQueryWithDefer {
  products {
    id
    ... @defer {
      reviews {
        id
        rating
      }
    }
    title
    mediaUrl
  }
}
`} />
