# GraphQL Testing Library

GraphQL Testing Library provides generic utilities for creating [Mock Service Worker](https://mswjs.io/) handlers for any GraphQL API. MSW is also the [Testing Library-recommended](https://testing-library.com/docs/react-testing-library/example-intro/#full-example) way to declaratively mock API communication in your tests without stubbing `window.fetch`.
